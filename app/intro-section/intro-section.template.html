                Hello, my name is Ian, I am 24 years old. I am a <em>Full Stack Developer</em>, a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu brown belt and I grew up in Indonesia.

                I started programming when I was in middle school. The first few programs I wrote were simple macros for a video game. I took a little bit of a break from programming while I went to boarding school and focused more on computer networking and math.

                My favorite thing about development is getting to learn new things. My favorite projects to work on are the ones where I get to use new technologies.
